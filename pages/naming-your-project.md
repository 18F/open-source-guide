### Before naming a project, think ‘Is this easy to understand?’

We recommend using descriptive names and avoid acronyms. It’s also important to check with your communications team before naming a project so that it can be cleared, if need be.

For example, if you were creating a template your coworkers could use to create guides, a good name for the repo might be *guides-template*. A bad name might be *the-unnamed-project-that-makes-it-easy-to-build-stuff*.
